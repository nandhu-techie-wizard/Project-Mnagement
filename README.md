** Assumptions Made During Development**

Users must log in to access the dashboard.

Each task has a unique task number generated automatically.

Tasks are assigned categories for better organization.

Only the creator or assigned user can edit a task.
**Technologies & Libraries Used****

Backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)

Express.js ‚Äì Web framework

MongoDB & Mongoose ‚Äì Database

JWT (jsonwebtoken) ‚Äì Authentication

bcrypt ‚Äì Password hashing

CORS ‚Äì Handling cross-origin requests

Frontend (React)

React.js ‚Äì UI framework

React Router ‚Äì Navigation

Axios ‚Äì API requests

Bootstrap (CDN) ‚Äì Styling

Vercel ‚Äì Frontend deployment

üìå Challenges Faced & Solutions

üîπ Challenge 1: Securing API Endpoints

Issue: Unauthorized users could access certain endpoints.

Solution: Implemented JWT authentication and protected routes using middleware.

üîπ Challenge 2: Handling CORS Errors

Issue: The frontend (Vercel) couldn't communicate with the backend (Render).

Solution: Installed CORS middleware in the backend:

npm install cors

Updated server.js:

const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors({ origin: "https://your-frontend.vercel.app" }));

üîπ Challenge 3: Task Filtering & Pagination

Issue: Too many tasks made the dashboard slow.

Solution: Implemented server-side pagination & filtering in MongoDB using query parameters.



 Next Steps


Improve UI/UX with better styling.

Add real-time notifications for task updates.
